            <h1 class="article-title">Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h1>
            <p class="article-text">The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. </p>
            <p class="article-text">The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick. The breed stands between 27–32 cm at the withers, and should weigh between 14–17 kg.</p>
            <p class="article-text">There are a greater number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed standard allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and brindle. </p>

            <p class="article-text">The first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership
                of 59 members. A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis began to appear in conformation shows. </p>

            <h1 class="article-title"> Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h1>
            <p class="article-text">Pembrokes feature pointed ears, and are somewhat smaller in stature than the Cardigan. They are low-set, intelligent, strong and sturdy with stamina sufficient to work a day on the farm. The common height at the withers is between 25–30 cm,
                while a male dog of this breed should weigh no more than 14 kg, and a female 11 kg. The tail is shorter than that of a Cardigan, which can be accomplished through breeding or docking.</p>
